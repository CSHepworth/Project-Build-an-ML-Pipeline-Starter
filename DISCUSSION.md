#### Improvements

- I would add more logger flags to know what was running when more often to help with debugging.

- I would use docker for environment management as opposed to conda. Docker could offer better control.

- I would break the process into more parts to ensure better management in cleaning and analyzing the data.

- I would also experiment with other config files and see how I could change the way the pipeline runs, thus leaving less need to alter program files.
